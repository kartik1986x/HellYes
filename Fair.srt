<c.yellow>you're blackmailing me </c><c.yellow> </c>

148
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,760
<c.yellow>See, you think </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>you're blackmailing me </c><c.yellow> </c>

149
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,000
<c.yellow>but you're not. </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>You're blackmailing him. </c><c.yellow> </c>

150
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000

<c.yellow>You're blackmailing him. </c><c.yellow> </c>

<c.yellow>You're blackmailing him. </c><c.yellow> </c>

152
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,000
<c.yellow>And he doesn't bluff. </c><c.yellow> </c>

153
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
<c.yellow>And he doesn't bluff. </c><c.yellow> </c>

154
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,000
<c.yellow>So... you really ought to </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>think about this. </c><c.yellow> </c>

155
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
<c.yellow>So... you really ought to </c><c.yellow> </c>

156
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,279
<c.yellow>So... you really ought to </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>think about this. </c><c.yellow> </c>

157
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,000
So you say she's not a gold-digger
because you offered her the money

158
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,680
So you say she's not a gold-digger
because you offered her the money

159
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,000
to do the test
and she turned you down.

160
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,559
to do the test
and she turned you down.

161
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,000
But now she's doing it
for twice the money.

162
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,760
But now she's doing it
for twice the money.

163
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,000
<c.yellow>You want her to vanish off </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>to France? </c><c.yellow> </c>

164
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,919
<c.yellow>You want her to vanish off </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>to France? </c><c.yellow> </c>

165
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:10,000
Maybe she's lying.

166
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,279
Maybe she's lying.

167
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,000
Maybe her mother's in,
I don't know, Mullingar

168
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Maybe her mother's in,
I don't know, Mullingar

169
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,360
Maybe her mother's in,
I don't know, Mullingar

170
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
and six months from now,
she turns up

171
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,279
and six months from now,
she turns up

172
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,000
looking for another two grand.
<c.yellow>The money is to do the test. </c><c.yellow> </c>

173
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,319
looking for another two grand.
<c.yellow>The money is to do the test. </c><c.yellow> </c>

174
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,000
<c.yellow>She's not going to do another one </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>in six months. </c><c.yellow> </c>

175
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
<c.yellow>She's not going to do another one </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>in six months. </c><c.yellow> </c>

176
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,000
So she finds another reason.
<c.yellow>I don't think she's a gold-digger. </c><c.yellow> </c>

177
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So she finds another reason.
<c.yellow>I don't think she's a gold-digger. </c><c.yellow> </c>

179
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,000
OK, fine. I'll tell you one thing.
She knows how to negotiate.

180
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
OK, fine. I'll tell you one thing.
She knows how to negotiate.

181
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
OK, fine. I'll tell you one thing.

OK, fine. I'll tell you one thing.
She knows how to negotiate.

183
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,000
Twice the price
and you're paying for it.

184
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,279
Twice the price
and you're paying for it.

185
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,000
<c.yellow>We're paying for it. </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>Oh. </c><c.yellow> </c>

<c.yellow>We're paying for it. </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>Oh. </c><c.yellow> </c>

187
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,000
James is going to chip in, is he?

James is going to chip in, is he?

189

<c.yellow>No, of course he's not. </c><c.yellow> </c>

<c.yellow>No, of course he's not. </c><c.yellow> </c>

191
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,000
<c.yellow>I'll pay it all if you want. </c><c.yellow> </c>

<c.yellow>I'll pay it all if you want. </c><c.yellow> </c>

193
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,000
No. It's a family expense

No. It's a family expense

No. It's a family expense

You'd use it for two weeks

215
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,000

<c.yellow>to '20s style I could find. </c><c.yellow> </c>

266
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,400
<c.yellow>It was the closest thing </c><c.yellow> </c>

267
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:36,000

<c.yellow>Why is that? </c><c.yellow> </c>

288
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,839
No, I think you should go though.
<c.yellow>Why is that? </c><c.yellow> </c>

289
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,000
What did we talk about before?

290
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,639
What did we talk about before?

291
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,000
Making new friends,
putting in a bit of an effort.

292
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Making new friends,
putting in a bit of an effort.

293
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,559
Making new friends,
putting in a bit of an effort.

294
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,000
<c.yellow>I'll think about it. </c><c.yellow> </c>

295
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,720
<c.yellow>I'll think about it. </c><c.yellow> </c>

296
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,000
<c.cyan>Jacinta. Hello. </c><c.cyan> </c>

What?
<c.yellow>Melanie. </c><c.yellow> </c>

307
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
<c.yellow>Just, you were ignoring me, in case
</c><c.yellow>you thought I was a stranger. </c><c.yellow> </c>

308
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000

</c><c.yellow>you thought I was a stranger. </c><c.yellow> </c>

310
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,000
I wasn't ignoring you.
<c.yellow>Still, I suppose it's better </c><c.yellow> </c>

311
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,120
I wasn't ignoring you.
<c.yellow>Still, I suppose it's better </c><c.yellow> </c>

312
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,000
<c.yellow>than being rude like the other day.
</c><c.yellow>I wasn't. </c><c.yellow> </c>

313
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,360
<c.yellow>than being rude like the other day.
</c><c.yellow>I wasn't. </c><c.yellow> </c>

314
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,000
<c.yellow>Oh, sorry, maybe that was </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>someone else. Who are you again? </c><c.yellow> </c>

315
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
<c.yellow>Oh, sorry, maybe that was </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>someone else. Who are you again? </c><c.yellow> </c>

<c.yellow>someone else. Who are you again? </c><c.yellow> </c>

317
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,000
So, a couple of days
should see us through.

318
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So, a couple of days
should see us through.

319
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So, a couple of days
should see us through.

320
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,000
<c.yellow>And then what? We, er, </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>we take a break and then do another?</c>

321
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
<c.yellow>And then what? We, er, </c><c.yellow> </c>

<c.yellow>we take a break and then do another?</c>

323
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,000
I always like to finish one thing
before talking about what's next.

324
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I always like to finish one thing
before talking about what's next.

325
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,080
I always like to finish one thing
before talking about what's next.

326
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,000
<c.yellow>Of course, yeah. </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>OK. </c><c.yellow> </c>

327
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,760
<c.yellow>Of course, yeah. </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>OK. </c><c.yellow> </c>

328
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll be in touch.
<c.yellow>Yeah. </c><c.yellow> </c>

329
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,680
I'll be in touch.
<c.yellow>Yeah. </c><c.yellow> </c>

330
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,000
<c.yellow>Look, we might have a problem. </c><c.yellow> </c>

331
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,559
<c.yellow>Look, we might have a problem. </c><c.yellow> </c>

332
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,000
<c.yellow>Zoe saw you handing me over </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>the cash. </c><c.yellow> </c>

333
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,440
<c.yellow>Zoe saw you handing me over </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>the cash. </c><c.yellow> </c>

334
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,000
So what?
<c.yellow>She thinks something's going on. </c><c.yellow> </c>

335
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So what?
<c.yellow>She thinks something's going on. </c><c.yellow> </c>

336
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,279
So what?
<c.yellow>She thinks something's going on. </c><c.yellow> </c>

337
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh?
<c.yellow>Look, it wasn't my fault. </c><c.yellow> </c>

338
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,040
Oh?
<c.yellow>Look, it wasn't my fault. </c><c.yellow> </c>

339
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,000
<c.yellow>I didn't even know </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>that she was there. </c><c.yellow> </c>

340
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
<c.yellow>I didn't even know </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>that she was there. </c><c.yellow> </c>

341
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,000
<c.yellow>I tried to cool things down and... </c>
<c.yellow>and it all got a bit messy. </c><c.yellow> </c>

342
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
<c.yellow>I tried to cool things down and... </c>
<c.yellow>and it all got a bit messy. </c><c.yellow> </c>

343
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,839
<c.yellow>I tried to cool things down and... </c>
<c.yellow>and it all got a bit messy. </c><c.yellow> </c>

344
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,000
Why? There's nothing to cool down,
she doesn't know anything.

345
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Why? There's nothing to cool down,
she doesn't know anything.

346
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,160
Why? There's nothing to cool down,
she doesn't know anything.

347
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,000
<c.yellow>She wants money </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>or she's going to go to the guards. </c>

348
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,639
<c.yellow>She wants money </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>or she's going to go to the guards. </c>

349
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,000
You give her nothing.

350
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,120
You give her nothing.

351
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,000
<c.yellow>Yeah, well, I tried that but don't </c>
<c.yellow>think that's going to work. </c><c.yellow> </c>

352
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,400
<c.yellow>Yeah, well, I tried that but don't </c>
<c.yellow>think that's going to work. </c><c.yellow> </c>

353
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,639
<c.yellow>So what do we do? </c><c.yellow> </c>

354
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,000
You don't do anything.

355
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,480
You don't do anything.

356
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You should have killed this
before it got this far.

357
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,639
You should have killed this
before it got this far.

358
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,000
But you couldn't even manage that.

359
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,599
But you couldn't even manage that.

360
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,000
So I'll deal with it.

361
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,959
So I'll deal with it.

362
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,559
<c.yellow>How? </c><c.yellow> </c>

363
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,720
Efficiently.

364
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,000
(EMMA) So, coffee?

365
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,120
(EMMA) So, coffee?

366
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:06,000
<c.yellow>Just give me the money. </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>We should talk. </c><c.yellow> </c>

367
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,279
<c.yellow>Just give me the money. </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>We should talk. </c><c.yellow> </c>

368
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:08,000
<c.yellow>About what? </c><c.yellow> </c>

369
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,879
<c.yellow>About what? </c><c.yellow> </c>

370
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, Holly, take a wild guess.

371
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,319
Well, Holly, take a wild guess.

372
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,000
<c.yellow>So, what, you're not going to give </c>
<c.yellow>me the money now unless we talk? </c><c.yellow> </c>

373
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
<c.yellow>So, what, you're not going to give </c>
<c.yellow>me the money now unless we talk? </c><c.yellow> </c>

374
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,760
<c.yellow>So, what, you're not going to give </c>
<c.yellow>me the money now unless we talk? </c><c.yellow> </c>

375
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,000
The result won't be
until the end of the day.

376
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,040
The result won't be
until the end of the day.

377
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,000
If James is the father...

378
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,680
If James is the father...

379
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,680
I'm sorry.

381
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, then, I'm Milo's granny.

382
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, then, I'm Milo's granny.

383
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:25,839
OMG, I'm an actual granny.

384
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,000
So shouldn't we talk about
what happens next?

385
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,519
So shouldn't we talk about
what happens next?

386
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,000
About what we want to happen?

387
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,120
About what we want to happen?

388
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,000
<c.yellow>That's up to me. </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>Excuse me? </c><c.yellow> </c>

389
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,760
<c.yellow>That's up to me. </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>Excuse me? </c><c.yellow> </c>

<c.yellow>So you ask her, </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>it's a nice gesture. </c><c.yellow> </c>

488
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000

Do you want to take a look

Do you want to take a look

496
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,000
You might find a costume
for the dance.

497
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,960
You might find a costume
for the dance.

498
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's ten to buy, five to rent.

499
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,599
It's ten to buy, five to rent.

500
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,000
<c.yellow>What's the catch? </c><c.yellow> </c>

<c.yellow>What do you mean? </c><c.yellow> </c>

502
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,000
<c.yellow>The trick, the joke, the insult. </c><c.yellow> </c>

503
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,919
<c.yellow>The trick, the joke, the insult. </c><c.yellow> </c>

504
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,000
There isn't one.
<c.yellow>Why? </c><c.yellow> </c>

505
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
There isn't one.
<c.yellow>Why? </c><c.yellow> </c>

506
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,680
There isn't one.
<c.yellow>Why? </c><c.yellow> </c>

507
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,000
Because it's not worth my time.

508
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,919
Because it's not worth my time.

509
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,000
I made you pay
for what you did to Fergal.

510
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,559
I made you pay

I'm satisfied. I won.

512

How's things with Gar?

524
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,839
How's things with Gar?

525
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,720
(LAUGHING) What?

526
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,000
<c.yellow>I told you. </c><c.yellow> </c>

527
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,680
<c.yellow>I told you. </c><c.yellow> </c>

528
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,000
<c.yellow>Me and Gar were one night. </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>There are no "things." </c><c.yellow> </c>

529
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
<c.yellow>Me and Gar were one night. </c><c.yellow> </c>

<c.yellow>There are no "things." </c><c.yellow> </c>

531
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,000
<c.yellow>So there's nothing </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>to let slip to Joan. </c><c.yellow> </c>

532
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,239
<c.yellow>So there's nothing </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>to let slip to Joan. </c><c.yellow> </c>

533
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,000
What are you talking about?
Why would I say that?

534
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What are you talking about?
Why would I say that?

535
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,159
What are you talking about?
Why would I say that?

536
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:40,000
<c.yellow>Look, Joan doesn't know </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>about me and Gar </c><c.yellow> </c>

537
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,199
<c.yellow>Look, Joan doesn't know </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>about me and Gar </c><c.yellow> </c>

538
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,000
<c.yellow>because there's </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>nothing to know about. </c><c.yellow> </c>

539
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,280
<c.yellow>because there's </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>nothing to know about. </c><c.yellow> </c>

540
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,680
Yeah, you just said that.

541
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,000
<c.yellow>So if you happen to mention </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>anything to her, </c><c.yellow> </c>

542
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
<c.yellow>So if you happen to mention </c><c.yellow> </c>

543
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,119
<c.yellow>So if you happen to mention </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>anything to her, </c><c.yellow> </c>

544
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,000
<c.yellow>all you'd be talking about </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>is a one-night stand. </c><c.yellow> </c>

545
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,680
<c.yellow>all you'd be talking about </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>is a one-night stand. </c><c.yellow> </c>

546
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,000
<c.yellow>And I don't think that </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>Joan would appreciate </c><c.yellow> </c>

547
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,040
<c.yellow>And I don't think that </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>Joan would appreciate </c><c.yellow> </c>

548
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,000
<c.yellow>hearing about her son's sex life. </c><c.yellow> </c>

549
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,640
<c.yellow>hearing about her son's sex life. </c><c.yellow> </c>

550
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,000
<c.yellow>Certainly not from an office junior.</c>

551
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
<c.yellow>Certainly not from an office junior.</c>

552

<c.yellow>Certainly not from an office junior.</c>

553
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:58,000
<c.yellow>If you're saying it to her, </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>who else are you saying it to? </c><c.yellow> </c>

554
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,519
<c.yellow>If you're saying it to her, </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>who else are you saying it to? </c><c.yellow> </c>

555
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm not saying it to anybody.
<c.yellow>Good. Best say nothing. </c><c.yellow> </c>

556
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000

<c.yellow>I'm looking out for you here, OK? </c><c.yellow> </c>

560
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,000
Sounds like you're looking out
for yourself.

561
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,440
Sounds like you're looking out
for yourself.

562

Oh, no, I wouldn't expect

OK, I, erm, I was doing
some business with JJ.

777
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000

No.

782
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:42,000
<c.yellow>What then? </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>It doesn't matter. </c><c.yellow> </c>

<c.yellow>It doesn't matter. </c><c.yellow> </c>

784
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,000
The thing is, like I told you,
somebody saw us.

785
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The thing is, like I told you,
somebody saw us.

786
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,640
The thing is, like I told you,
somebody saw us.

787
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,000
JJ handing me over cash.

788
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,400
JJ handing me over cash.

789

Yeah. It was Zoe.

792
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,879
Yeah. It was Zoe.

793
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:58,000
She got the idea
that something was happening.

794
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,199
She got the idea
that something was happening.

795
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:00,000
Now she's looking for some money
to keep quiet.

796
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,680
Now she's looking for some money
to keep quiet.

797
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,000
<c.yellow>You're kidding me. Zoe? How much? </c><c.yellow> </c>

<c.yellow>You're kidding me. Zoe? How much? </c><c.yellow> </c>

800
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,000
That doesn't matter either.

801
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,320
That doesn't matter either.

802
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:08,000
But... look. I'm obviously
not going to pay

803
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But... look. I'm obviously
not going to pay

804
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,519
But... look. I'm obviously
not going to pay

805
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,000
because you pay, you're admitting
there's something dodgy going on.

806
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
because you pay, you're admitting
there's something dodgy going on.

807
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,239
because you pay, you're admitting

808
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,000
<c.yellow>Wait, if you're not going to pay, </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>is she going to the guards? </c><c.yellow> </c>

<c.yellow>Wait, if you're not going to pay, </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>is she going to the guards? </c><c.yellow> </c>

810
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,000
She can't prove anything.
<c.yellow>If she starts gabbing off, </c><c.yellow> </c>

811
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
She can't prove anything.

813
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,000
<c.yellow>guards are going to come </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>sniffing around. </c><c.yellow> </c>

814
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,960
<c.yellow>guards are going to come </c><c.yellow> </c>

815
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
<c.yellow>JJ's not going to like that. </c><c.yellow> </c>

816
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,839
<c.yellow>JJ's not going to like that. </c><c.yellow> </c>

817
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,000
<c.yellow>Maybe you'd be better off </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>paying her. </c><c.yellow> </c>

818
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,760
<c.yellow>Maybe you'd be better off </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>paying her. </c><c.yellow> </c>

819
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:28,000
<c.yellow>You don't want JJ knowing </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>anything about this. </c><c.yellow> </c>

820
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
<c.yellow>You don't want JJ knowing </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>anything about this. </c><c.yellow> </c>

<c.yellow>anything about this. </c><c.yellow> </c>

822
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,599
<c.yellow>What? </c><c.yellow> </c>

823
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,000
He knows.

824
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,000
<c.yellow>She said it to him as well? </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>No, I did. </c><c.yellow> </c>

825
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,360
<c.yellow>She said it to him as well? </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>No, I did. </c><c.yellow> </c>

826
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,000
<c.yellow>What did he say? </c><c.yellow> </c>
<c.yellow>He said he'll deal with it. </c><c.yellow> </c>

<c.yellow>He said he'll deal with it. </c><c.yellow> </c>

828
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,000
And then he wanted to see Zoe
and that was over an hour ago.

829
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And then he wanted to see Zoe
and that was over an hour ago.

And then he wanted to see Zoe
and that was over an hour ago.

831
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,720
I don't know what to do.

832
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,000
Should I call him,
tell him to back off? What?

833
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Should I call him,
tell him to back off? What?

834
